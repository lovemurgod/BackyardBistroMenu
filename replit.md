# Overview

This is a full-stack web application for "The Backyard Bistro" - a restaurant menu showcase system built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. The application features an elegant, animated restaurant menu interface with category-based navigation, allowing users to browse different menu sections like beverages, soups, salads, burgers, pizza, pasta, and mains. The frontend uses modern UI components with smooth animations and a luxurious design theme, while the backend provides a foundation for data management and API endpoints.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The application uses a React-based single-page application (SPA) architecture with TypeScript for type safety. The frontend is built with Vite as the build tool and development server, providing fast hot module replacement and optimized production builds. The UI is constructed using shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, ensuring accessibility and consistent design patterns.

The routing is handled by Wouter, a lightweight client-side router that provides declarative route definitions. State management is implemented using TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, offering caching, background updates, and optimistic updates capabilities.

The component architecture follows a modular approach with separate components for different UI sections:
- Opening animation and welcome screen
- Category tiles for menu navigation
- Menu display components for individual categories
- Floating background elements for visual enhancement

## Backend Architecture
The backend uses Express.js as the web server framework with TypeScript for type safety. The server is configured with middleware for JSON parsing, URL encoding, and request logging. The architecture includes a modular route registration system that separates API endpoints from the main server configuration.

A storage abstraction layer is implemented through an interface-based approach, currently using in-memory storage with the capability to easily swap to database-backed storage. This provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios and makes testing easier.

## Data Storage Solutions
The application is configured to use PostgreSQL as the primary database, managed through Drizzle ORM. The database configuration uses Neon Database's serverless PostgreSQL for cloud deployment. The schema defines a users table with fields for ID, username, and password, using UUID generation for primary keys.

Database migrations are handled through Drizzle Kit, allowing for version-controlled schema changes and easy deployment updates. The current storage implementation provides both in-memory storage for development/testing and database connectivity for production use.

## Authentication and Authorization
The system includes a basic user authentication schema with username/password credentials. The users table is set up with unique username constraints and password storage. Session management is configured using connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions, providing persistent login states across server restarts.

Form validation is implemented using Zod schemas generated from Drizzle table definitions, ensuring type safety between the database schema and application logic.

## External Dependencies
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database hosting with connection pooling and automatic scaling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design and custom styling
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions and interactive elements
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI components providing accessibility features and consistent behavior
- **Google Fonts**: External font loading for Playfair Display, Dancing Script, and Inter typefaces

The application uses a comprehensive set of UI components including forms, dialogs, navigation menus, data tables, and interactive elements, all built with accessibility in mind. The styling system uses CSS custom properties for theming, supporting both light and dark modes with a luxury restaurant aesthetic featuring deep blues, gold accents, and cream backgrounds.
